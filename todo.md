To Do:

Set up migrations and models: User, Emotion, Emoting (join bet. user/emotion), Cohort, CheckIn (has many prompts), Prompt  
Set up associations from User perspective only, seed to test pieces in place (YAGNI YAGNI YAGNI - go slow!)  
Set up User validations and authentication
Create/connect/enable view for individual prompt
Create/connect/enable view for checkin summary
Create/connect/enable user profile view
Write associations and methods on CheckIn/Prompt to handle comparison with cohort
STOP WRITING TOO MUCH AHEAD OF TIME AND GET TO WORK!
